# Work-Day-Planner

## Top of the Application

    When you open up the webpage, the date and time that is set to your local machine will appear under the Work Day Planner header at the top. 
    Along with below being each time block available during business hours.

## Time Block Planning Section

    Here is the section that denotates an hour of planning available for the user. By inputting data in the text area, it will then put the item into local storage
    when you click the button on the right hand side of each time block. From here, you may either open console and check local storage to see that the itemized list of plans
    you have set up will display.

## Color Coding of the time blocks 

    Within the text area allocated for each hour of the business day, you will notice that there will be 3 different colors representing past, present and future. Green will be 
    dedicated to future hour blocks that you may plan, red represents the present hour block and grey representing previous hour blocks that have passed already.
